                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>In this project, we were introduced to using grids in CSS to make our projects responsive. We continued to use our given art style, which was in my case Film Noir.

                    I originally did a non-responsive webpage, which I was later on supposed to implement grids and media query in. I however decided to change the entire layout, since I wanted to focus on more UX friendly design. It made sense to me to clean the page up, so I moved away from the illustrations I did for the original one and kept it to a clean and simple layout.

                <h3>Problems</h3>
                    <p>In this project I was pretty uncomfortable with grids since it was a new concept to me but managed to make the pages responsive, all except for one. 
                    </p>

                <h3>Solutions</h3>
                    <p>What I have learned today is that my way of setting up codes was in a no way professional, making it extremely difficult to spot problems once they arose, which they always eventually do.
                    </p>

                <h3>Overall Learning</h3>
                    <p>I am happy with the learning results, and even though I do like the graphic and layouts in those pages, I know that now that if I would have had more control over my codes, they would have looked much nicer

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>This was one of my most favorite subjects of the semester. I have personally a very strong interest in creating graphics, animation and storytelling, so after this course I definitely felt that I had found where my main interest lies in the subject of multimedia design.

                            Originally we created a website with an animated sprite sheet, which I really enjoyed. I went with the Year Walk theme, and in the process polished my own personal illustration style, which I then continued to develop over the semester.

                            Later in the course, I took part in a group project where we created an interactive movie poster based in the movie The Shining. The group work went great since we were all extremely interested in our roles, and we still to this day continue to work together as a group.

                            <p>Since I had already a lot of experience with illustrating, my new challenges were communication with the coder. Since we already had established a close working relationship, we made sure to stay in sync throughout the process.

                            <p>In our case it went very well, but I learned that it is extremely important to stay on the same timeline as the people responsible for technical challenges and coding.

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>In this project, I reconciled with old passion of mine with filming. We worked in teams to create two types of videos. One was a story without words and made in one day with an iPhone.  The later one was made on much larger scales with more design restrictions, resulting in a webpage and a video guide for safe bicycling in Copenhagen. We also created a social media profile where we showed clips from the process, and kind of turned our project into a propaganda.
                            </p>
                                <br>

                        <h3>Problems</h3>
                            <p>Communication problems arose between coders and designers, as well as distance and vacation made it hard to stay on the same pace across responsibility fields. The page was therefore not responsive, which made it work differently between screens, which was a shame since the UX design was extremely nice.
                            Other problems were sirens practice that happened on a day of shooting, which ruined many of our soundclips.
                            </p>
                                <br>

                        <h3>Solutions</h3>
                            <p>We had a very good and organized timeline within the video crew, so we had a lot of time to fix the clips where sounds were ruined, making the video project a great success.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Overall Learning</h3>
                            <p>Once again I saw how important communications cross fields are in order for a project to be a success. Since my focus was on the video production however, I was extremely happy with our results. I got introduced to new programs that I continued to work personal projects on, creating a new set of skills that will be very useful in the future.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>We were handed the project of creating an updated version of Fronter. We choose to aim it towards students, and our goal was to make the page more intuitive and simple. Finally, we were supposed to create a web prototype for the project.In the end of the course, we got a new project of creating a native app for Moonbar. Our goal was to strengthen the communication between the Danish and international Multimedia Design departments, which resulted in more options in interaction within the bar between students through the app.

                <h3>Problems</h3>
                    <p>In the XD prototype, we had problems with the logos we had made in order to replace as much text as we could. So the experts had hard time navigating the page. So we immediately decided to improve our logos.I had some major difficulties with the web prototype since I had not practiced coding at all for a long time, and made the mistake of bootstrapping the page I was doing without much knowledge on how to do it. The site eventually crashed, leaving me with no final webpage.

                <h3>Solutions</h3>
                    <p>I decided to go back to point one in coding, and relearn how to build up a code in a clear and professional way. It was the best decision I could have made, since now I feel like I have a good control and understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I did have to start with the web prototype from the beginning, but it was worth learning how to do things properly again.

                <h3>Overall Learning</h3>
                    <p>I learned that you should not build up your programming skills on shortcuts and quick-fixes. I also developed a new way of building a webpage, where I focus on making sure that all placements have been made according to the prototypeâs wireframe, codes are working and javascript is functioning.  So, while making the final Portfolio, I restricted myself to add content until I was completely sure everything was working. This has proven to be a major learning process and definitely the biggest one of the semester, since coding was my biggest weakness.
